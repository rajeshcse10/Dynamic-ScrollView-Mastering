(I'm new to Auto-Layout & iOS stuff).Both UILabels are connected to each other from Top & Bottom, and are Horizontally aligned to superview. And when I change content of one of the UILabel, UIView and UILabel does not resize as required.Please suggest. Attaching screenshots for current constraints.",
